# Air Quality Analysis Dashboard in Power BI

## Overview

The **Air Quality Analysis Dashboard** project focuses on visualizing and analyzing air quality data to monitor and assess pollution levels in different regions. Using Power BI, this project provides an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore various air quality metrics such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, and other key pollutants. The goal is to empower stakeholders with insights to help them take informed actions to improve air quality and public health.

## Objectives

- **Visualize Air Quality Metrics**: Create interactive charts and visualizations for key air quality parameters (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, etc.).
- **Trend Analysis**: Track air quality trends over time for different regions, helping stakeholders understand patterns and fluctuations.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Use maps and geographical data to visualize air quality across different locations.
- **Insightful Reports**: Provide actionable insights through reports that can be easily interpreted by non-technical stakeholders.
- **Data-driven Decisions**: Enable informed decision-making for environmental agencies, health organizations, and policymakers to address air pollution concerns.

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Fully interactive Power BI dashboard for exploring air quality data.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Visualize air quality trends over days, months, or years.
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Use Power BI’s mapping features to display regional air quality data.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare air quality metrics across different regions or time periods.
- **Data Filtering**: Allow users to filter the data by region, time period, and pollutant types.

## Technologies Used

- **Tool**: Power BI
- **Data Source**: Air quality dataset (CSV)
- **Visualizations**:
  - Line charts, bar charts, and area charts for time-based analysis.
  - Maps for geospatial analysis.
